## Hi there 👋

<!--
Hi! I’m Kenzo 👋
I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and a Master’s degree in Economics and Public Policy, and I’m deeply passionate about data analysis.

I enjoy working on projects that involve economic, financial, and political insights, as these are the areas that truly motivate me. I’m especially interested in using data to understand complex systems, support decision-making, and tell meaningful stories through analysis.

📊 Here you can find my data analysis and data science projects, which mainly involve the use of SQL, Python, and Power BI, often complemented with AI-driven approaches to automate processes, extract insights, and enhance analytical workflows.

I focus on building end-to-end projects, from data extraction and cleaning to modeling, visualization, and insight generation, always aiming to apply analytical and AI tools to real-world problems.
